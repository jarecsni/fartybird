# Task Completion Markers

## Checkbox Format

When marking tasks as complete in task lists or implementation plans, use the green tick mark emoji:

- ✅ Correct: `[✅]` for completed tasks
- ❌ Incorrect: `[x]` for completed tasks

## Example

```markdown
- [✅] 1. Completed task
  - [✅] 1.1 Completed subtask
  - [ ] 1.2 Incomplete subtask
- [ ] 2. Incomplete task
```

## Rationale

The green tick mark (✅) provides better visual feedback and is more universally recognized as a completion indicator than the letter 'x'.
